## URL Routing
A URL is a uniform resource locator. It contains the address that links to a resource such as an HTML page.In Django, the premise is exactly the same. 
Inside each project is a `urls.py` file in the root directory. Django stores URLs in this file. Whenever a user types in the URL path, this file find 
the pattern that the user typed into the browser and return a page back to the user. Django based on whatever URL was matched, then triggers the function and 
the function returns back the page that the user is looking for.
