# DjangoProject
## Day-1

This project is to create a fully functional website created using Django. This project is created in Ubuntu.

## Django
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. 
Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. 
It’s free and open source.

* Ridiculously fast.
  * Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
* Reassuringly secure.
  * Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistake.
* Exceedingly scalable.
  * Some of the busiest sites on the Web leverage Django’s ability to quickly and flexibly scale.

## Why do you need a framework?
To understand what Django is actually for, we need to take a closer look at the servers. The first thing is that the server needs to know that you want it to serve you a web page.

Imagine a mailbox (port) which is monitored for incoming letters (requests). This is done by a web server. The web server reads the letter and then sends a response with a webpage. But when you want to send something, you need to have some content. And Django is something that helps you create the content.

## What happens when someone requests a website from your server?
When a request comes to a web server, it's passed to Django which tries to figure out what is actually requested. It takes a web page address first and tries to figure out what to do. This part is done by Django's urlresolver (note that a website address is called a URL – Uniform Resource Locator – so the name urlresolver makes sense). It is not very smart – it takes a list of patterns and tries to match the URL. Django checks patterns from top to bottom and if something is matched, then Django passes the request to the associated function (which is called view).

Imagine a mail carrier with a letter. She is walking down the street and checks each house number against the one on the letter. If it matches, she puts the letter there. This is how the urlresolver works!

In the view function, all the interesting things are done: we can look at a database to look for some information. Maybe the user asked to change something in the data? Like a letter saying, "Please change the description of my job." The view can check if you are allowed to do that, then update the job description for you and send back a message: "Done!" Then the view generates a response and Django can send it to the user's web browser.

## Installation
1.Django is written in Python. We need Python to do anything in Django. Let's start by installing it! We want you to install the latest version of Python 3, so if you have any earlier version, you will need to upgrade it. If you already have version 3.6 or higher you should be fine.
 ```
  $ sudo apt install python3
 ```
2.Install pip    
 ```
  $ sudo apt install python3-pip
 ```
3.Install Django
 ```
  $ pip install django
 ```
 
 ## Create a Project
Create a Django project using the following command:
 ```
  $ django-admin startproject project_name
 ```

## Run the project
In the project directory
 ```
  $ python3 manage.py runserver
 ```
 
## Creating an app
To create an app for the project
 ```
  $ python3 manage.py startapp app_name
 ```

## Configuring the app to our project
Open settings.py in the project folder in the project directory and add the app_name as a list item in the INSTALLED_APPS.
